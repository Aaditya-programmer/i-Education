        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. </p>.

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> According to consensus in modern genetics, anatomically modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago. However, the earliest known human remains in India date to 30,000 years ago. Settled life, which involves the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began in South Asia around 7,000 BCE. At the site of Mehrgarh, Balochistan, Pakistan, presence can be documented of the domestication of wheat and barley, rapidly followed by that of goats, sheep, and cattle. By 4,500 BCE, settled life had spread more widely, and began to gradually evolve into the Indus Valley Civilization, an early civilization of the Old world, which was contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. This civilization flourished between 2,500 BCE and 1900 BCE in what today is Pakistan and north-western India and was noted for its urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage, and water supply.

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> In the modern world education is not just a requirement and moral value, but also an expensive market product. One of the major characteristics of modern education is the directly proportional relationship between the age of educational institution and its value. While other market products value innovation and complete change and modernization of the portfolio, education values proposition based on the conservative and tested system that is checked and evaluated through years. Thus, when we talk about modern education, we assume combination of technological developments and conservatives of old and traditional educational institutions.


        WRITE AWESOME ESSAY FOR ME
        Let us look at such sound names as Harvard, Oxford or Cambridge. The name is the prestige that a lot of people trying to get and this reputation makes these universities attract the best intellectuals from all over the globe. Educational system puts a lot of efforts to keep traditions and conservative elements of the educational process. </p>.
